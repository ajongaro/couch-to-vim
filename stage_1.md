# Mind Your HJKL's

The most important thing you'll need to know about Vim is that it operates in different _modes_.
The two modes you need to know right now are the `-NORMAL-` and `-INSERT-` modes.

By default, you'll be in `-NORMAL-` mode.
This allows you to navigate a text file using keys that would normally type _letters_ in your editor.

For example:
`h` moves your cursor to the left.
`l` moves your cursor to the right.
`j` moves your cursor down.
`k` moves your cursor up.

          ↑
          k 
      ← h   l →
          j
          ↓

Those are the first four _movement_ keys you'll need to know.
Expect to spend a day or two practicing the muscle memory needed for those four keys.
It's goofy at first, but you'll get fast before you know it!

Try practicing with this [Ruby file](/stage_1) and then...

Play the first _free_ level of [vim-adventures](www.vim-adventures.com) as a way to build that muscle memory.
You don't need to buy the game, just replay the first few levels until your `hjkl`s start feeling more comfortable.

Move on to [Stage Two](/stage_2.md) when you're ready. Good luck!
