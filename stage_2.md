# We're Not Normal

Now that you know the four most basic movements in `-NORMAL-` mode, I imagine you'll want to _actually type something_ now.

To do that, you'll need to enter `-INSERT-` mode using the `i` key.
Just think "_i_ want to type something".

By default, you'll be in `-NORMAL-` mode.
This allows you to navigate a text file using keys that would normally type _letters_ in your editor.

For example:
`h` moves your cursor to the left.
`l` moves your cursor to the right.
`j` moves your cursor down.
`k` moves your cursor up.

          ↑
          k 
      ← h   l →
          j
          ↓

Those are the first four _movement_ keys you'll need to know.
Expect to spend a day or two practicing the muscle memory needed for those four keys.
It's goofy at first, but you'll get fast.

I recommend playing the first few _free_ levels of [vim-adventures](www.vim-adventures.com) as a way to begin building that muscle memory.

Move on to [Stage Two](/stage_two.md) when you're ready. Good luck!
