# We're Not Normal Anymore

Now that you know the four most basic movements in `-NORMAL-` mode, I imagine you'll want to _actually type something_ now.

To do that, you'll need to enter `-INSERT-` mode using the `i` key.
Just think "_i_ want to type something".

When you're done typing, hit `Escape (Esc)` to return back to `-NORMAL-` and navigate away.

In `-INSERT-` mode, your editor behaves exactly like you're used to.
For now, try to avoid staying in this mode too long, and don't use the arrow keys if possible.

So you know how to move around with `hjkl` and delete the character under the cursor with `x`.
And now, type whatever you want using `i` to enter `-INSERT-` mode, and `Esc` to return to normal mode. 

Yes, you're going to be hitting escape a lot â€” which is why most people change the `Caps-lock` key to `Escape`.
Learn how (and why) to do this on Mac in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/OCBJQMgkogc).

Go back to [Stage One Ruby](/stage_2.rb) and fill in the parameters with some new variable names (where x used to be) to practice insert!

Then, move on to [Stage Three](/stage_3.md) when you're ready. Good luck!
