# Use your hjkl navigation skills, delete with x, and -INSERT- mode to change the parameter names to 'insert'
# Move the cursor over the x parameter in each method.
# You're about to learn something new, too - numbers!

  # Place your cursor on the 'a' and type 4x.

  # This works for (pretty much) all Vim motions and actions.
  # Try using `4l` below to go right four spaces.
