# Letters? Pff. Words!

"Wait a second," I hear you say.
"I thought Vim was supposed to be faster than the silly arrow keys."
"How is this any better?"

Oh, we're just getting started â€” make sure those finger tips are thoroughly coconut oiled.
Because we're turning the speed up to: Blazing.

Start thinking of programming with Vim key bindings like playing Mortal Kombat or Super Mario Bro's.
It's about taking concepts and combining them to execute _killer_ moves that will make your enemies weep.

To take your vim skills to the next level, it's time to hit the `web`.

In `-NORMAL-` mode...

`w` moves to the beginning of the next word.
`e` moves to the end of the current (or next) word (if you're already at the end of the current word).
`b` moves backwards to the beginning of the previous word.

And just like the stage_2 exercise, you can add a number before the movement to repeat it.
`2w` moves you to the beginning of the word after next, just like hitting `w` twice.

This is where things start getting pretty spicy, but it's also _just the beginning_ of the speed you can reach.

Check out [Stage Three Ruby](/stage_3.rb) for some practice and a new skill that leverages `web`.
