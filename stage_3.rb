# As a reminder, w goes to beginning of next word, e to end of current or next word,
# and b goes back to beginning of this or previous word.

  # What happens when you start on x below and hit w over and over?

  # Use `w` to navigate to the beginning of the word `black` and delete the 'b' with `x`
    orange orange orange orange black orange orange
  # Then, hit `e` to move to the end of the word 'black' and delete the 'k'  with `x`
  # See how you can use w/e/b to hit different parts of the word? `b` just goes _back_.
